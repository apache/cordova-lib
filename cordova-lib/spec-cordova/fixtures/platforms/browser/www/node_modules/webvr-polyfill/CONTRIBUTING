# Building

This project uses browserify to manage dependencies and build. Watchify is
especially convenient to preserve the write-and-reload model of development.
This package lives in the npm index.

Relevant commands:

    npm install - installs the dependencies.
    npm build - builds the module.
    npm watch - auto-builds the module whenever any source changes.


# Updating the npm entry

Once changes are made, a new version can be published to the index using the
following commands:

    npm version <NEW_VERSION>
    npm publish
    git push --tags
